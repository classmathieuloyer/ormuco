# Ormuco technical test

## Description

These are the answers for questions on Ormuco's technical test.

## Author

Mathieu Loyer

## Platforms
This was completed on MacOs Mojave using python 2.7.15 and should be compatible
with linux and python version 3.3+

## Operation

### a.py
Takes two lines of non zero legth on the x axis. The lines can be given as
tuples or lists and can be delimited by integers of floats.
For conviniance, this module can be invoked from the command line as such
python a.py x1 x2 x3 x4

Examples:
A typical call from a python module after import will be as such
~~~~
a.are_lines_overlaping([-10, -5.3], [-7, 0])
~~~~
This case will return True

A call from the command line as such
~~~~
python a.py -10.1 -5.0 -7.1 0
~~~~
Will have the following output
~~~~
Lines overlaping?: True
~~~~


### b.py
Takes two version strings as input and outputs -1, 0 or 1 according to if the
first version string is smaller than, equal to or larger than the second
version string.

Examples:
A typical call from a python module after import will be as such
~~~~
b.compare_versions('1.1.1', '1.1.1')
b.compare_versions('5_1b_1', '5_1_1', '_')

~~~~
These calls will return 0 and 1 respectively

A call from the command line as such
~~~~
python3 b.py 5_1b_1 5_1_1 _
~~~~
Will have the following output
~~~~
5_1b_1 is LARGER than 5_1_1
~~~~


### c.py
Lru, least recently used values are replaced when capacity is at maximum, stale 
values are dropped on query.

Missing features:
* Geo Distributed
* Resilient to network failures or crashes.
